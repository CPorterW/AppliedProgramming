# Overview

I created this program to demonstrate the integration of VSCode, Python, and Git. This was also my first use of Markdown and Virtual Environments. 

Virtual Environment creation command for Mac
* python3 -m venv {MyVenvName}

This program displays 'Hello World!' in the console.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
